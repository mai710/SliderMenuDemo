SliderMenuDemo
==============

An pull-down style menu geared for working with autolayout and constraints.
IB friendly. Attach the menu view to be dragged and refernce the constraint that will animate the view up and down. The constraint is animated and not the frame, making it work with autolayout. 
Set the top and bottom locks to determine where the menu lock to when closed and opened.
